## Introduction

<details>

#### What are you building?

We have developed a web application that enables users to complete a series of challenges,such as Get Organised, which consist of clusters of small, manageable tasks called 'micro-habits'. The aim is to help children aged 10/11 develop good habits by programming themselves to work through these challenges.

#### Why are you building it?

Creating new habits is a process that takes time, multiple tries and effort. By repeating small, positive micro-habits that accumulate, children can significantly reduce the time and effort required. A cluster of related habits all contribute to a common "challenge", which is a goal that children may aspire to achieve, such as getting healthy or getting organised. Our app provides a structured and organized approach to help children develop new good habits related to their goals, making the process more enjoyable.

## Project Scope

<details>

#### What are you not building?

Due to regulatory requirements for developing apps for children, we have decided not to include authentication. Our app does not provide an online database of teachers and students for users to connect with, nor is it a general social networking app or a game. We also do not intend to add separate tasks to children's daily homework or other duties through our app.

#### How did you decide what features were important?

We conducted user research and usability testing to gather valuable feedback from our users. This helped us refine our initial concept and understand how users interacted with the prototype, guiding us to target the user stories for our MVP.

</details>

## Project plan

<details>

#### How are you going to structure your sprints?

Throughout the project we were focused on getting an MVP done for the product owener, which consisted of several user stories.

So instead of targeting user stories we decided to break down the user stories into smaller more managable issues which would then come together to form one complete user story.

We tracked our progress using a kanban board and issue estimation to determine our velocity when working on certain issues.

#### What order are you going to build in?

Our plan was to start off by building a bare-bones skeleton of all the pages throughout the app so that we had a starting point from which we could build upon. It also acted as a way of reminding us of the scope of the project as we continued to build.

#### How did user research inform your plan?

Based upon significant work undertaken with primary school children, our starting aim was to develop a companion app to help them develop positive skills and behaviours by nudging them to adopt them into their everyday lives.

Having identified that transitioning to secondary school was critical, I wanted to explore how a digital tool might support young people through that process, so I convened a group of target users aged 10-11 to participate in user research that included:

Identifying user needs

A short survey was used to question users about their digital habits - how much time they spent online, levels of parental control around usage, the kind of apps they liked most and whether they ever used apps to learn new things. Desk-based research and interviews with a small user group followed to find out more about how they might respond to using an app that would 'nudge' them to adopt particular behaviours'. We gathered insights into user pain points and motivations around their struggles:

- defining issues around new organisational skills that were required,
- challenges of navigating an inevitably bigger school, and
- connecting with peers going through a similar experience or those who had recently experienced what they were going through.

Prioritising features

The user research also helped prioritise the challenge-based feature under development. This feature will enable users to choose and participate in defined simple tasks that we hope will help them develop 'micro-habits' to overcome the identified challenges. The prioritisation process, informed by user research, enabled us to allocate resources effectively and ensure we could deliver a prototype product with value to users.

Defining a user persona

User research helped create a user persona to represent our target audience. This persona was used to guide the development of our product and will be revisited as we prepare our marketing and communication strategy.

## Requirement analysis

<details>

#### How will you ensure your project is accessible to as many users as possible?

Accessibility principles informed all of our decisions (choice of font-background colors that contrast, button colours, etc.)

#### Are there any legal or regulatory requirements you should consider?

There are several legal and regulatory requirements to consider when developing apps for children, including:

-Age Appropriate Design Code: In 2020, the UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) released an Age Appropriate Design Code, which provides guidance for designing online services (including apps) suitable for children. The code includes privacy requirements, data use, content design, and user interface design.

-GDPR compliance: The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a data protection regulation that applies to all businesses operating in the European Union, including the UK. If your app collects personal data from users, including children, you must comply with the GDPR's requirements, which include obtaining parental consent and providing privacy notices.

-Advertising Standards Authority: The UK's advertising regulator is the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). The ASA has specific rules around advertising to children, including restrictions on advertising certain products (such as alcohol, gambling, and tobacco) and requirements around making it clear when advertising is advertising.

-British Board of Film Classification: The British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) is responsible for classifying films and other content in the UK. While the BBFC's classification system is not mandatory for apps, it can be used to ensure that app content is suitable for children.
Accessibility: In the UK, the Equality Act 2010 requires that digital content, including apps, be accessible to people with disabilities. This includes ensuring that your app is usable by individuals with visual or hearing impairments and those with mobility or cognitive disabilities.

## Research and findings

<details>

#### What did you find out from user testing?

    From user testing we found that:

    - All users wanted less boring font and less text
    - The graphics should be consistent
    - Children love trophies, or other forms of rewards that has a value to it
    - It would be nice to be congratulated for completing a micro-habit
    - The users loved the fact that there was positive encouragement to complete micro habits and wanted to see MORE of it
    - A pomodoro timer for certain tasks such as brushing your teeth would be useful
    - We should make the challenges page easier to find
    - It would be nice to have a confirmation pop-up to allow users to confirm that they have comepleted a task.
    - The wording tasks makes them sound like chores, we should consider calling them something else.
    - Consider re-writing some of the micro-habits/challenges as some of them are not relevant.
    - We should replace Day 1, Day 2, etc.... with actual dates like Monday 3rd April

### Analysis

<details>

#### What might be the intended and unintended consequences of building this product?

Having a young userbase, we had some initial concerns around their safety in using the app: - ensuring their details were safe - avoiding opportunities for them to connect with unknown peers - ensuring communication with peers was safe and guided by the app

We curtailed our MVP to bypass a login feature, to prioritise the core app functionality as a well-working prototype.

---

We had some concerns around efficient deployment while using next.js and SQLite and incompatibility with Vercel.

</details>

### Design

<details>

#### How did you plan a user experience?

#### What technical decisions did you make?

We debated between using express.js, next.js, or React Native. The decision to not use React Native was due to the time constraints of the project, and would be an entirely new tech stack for us as a team to learn. While we had similar amounts of experience with express.js and next.js, we opted for the latter down to its usibility, magic, and overall experience.

#### Server-render vs client-render vs both

#### Relational or non-relational or no DB

#### Self-hosted or platform-as-a-service

#### Frontend first vs DB first

#### Did you create a technical specification?

</details>

### Implementation/Build

<details>

#### How did you ensure your code was good?

`Create logical and maintainable code to deliver project outcomes, explaining their choice of approach. (S1)`

#### What interesting technical problems did you have to solve?

`Outline and apply the rationale and use of algorithms, logic and data structures. (K9, S16)`

#### How did you debug issues that arose?

`Apply structured techniques to problem solving to identify and resolve issues and debug basic flaws in code (S7)`

</details>

### Test

<details>
    
#### How did you verify your project worked correctly?

At first we verified features worked as expected by running the local server and using `console.log` to solve errors as the project codebase expanded. Towards the end of the project we were able to implement some E2E testing using the [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) testing framework. With limited time available, we tested some core, but light functionality:

- Navigation on first entrance to the app (where NavBars are not yet shown)
- Desktop view shows the correct navbar and can direct users to the designated pages
- Mobile view shows the correct navbar and can direct users to the designated pages
- When tasks are completed, the client-side renders an updated percentage progress
- The correct dates are printed for yesterday, today, and tomorrow when called

#### Did writing automated tests catch any bugs?

When writing tests for the DatePrinter component, errors appeared despite the component appearing to work as planned. The test showed the date rendered by the `date-fns` driven component renders a date some milliseconds faster than the JavaScript Date() method, which resulted in a mismatch when comparing 'today' presented by the `DatePrinter()` and `new Date()`. While this doesn't _break_ any of the code, it does result in some artificial errors by ensuring that the correct back end data feeds the correct date. The test was refactored to test that the date checked against that rendered by the `DatePrinter()` and shown in the `/days` page was correct by formatting the `new Date()` using the in-built `addDays()` and `format` functionality in `date-fns`.

</details>

### Deploy

<details>

#### Where/how did you deploy your application?

`Review and justify their contribution to building, managing and deploying code into the relevant environment in accordance with the project specification (S10)`

We had a few choices for deployment, our first choice was to deploy on Vercel but we decided that Fly.io would be our best bet for our chosen tech stack. We implemented continuous deployment on GitHub so that it was always up to date with the main branch. By the end of the project, deployment was not successful.

#### What problems did you encounter during deployment?

There were many issues with deployment:

    1. Vercel does not support databases
    2. The app runs out of memory on Fly.io
    3. Default next configuration is not friendly to database access, causing problems with seeding
    4. Database deploying to the wrong directory
    5. Database deleting itself
    6. Fetching data does not work as expected
